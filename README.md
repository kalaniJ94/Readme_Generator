# <README-Generator>

## Description

This challenge was especially unique , as it was the first time I had worked with more "server side" applications, rather than directly interfacing with a webpage. There are obvious differences to be found, and some not so obvious. One not so obvious difference is a mental shift that has to happen when you are removed from the "visual" aspect of working with a webpage. It was challenging, and enjoyable. 

This project in particular, a README generator, seems rather obvious once you have a grasp of inquirer, but the process of adding switch statements and modifying data based on user input proved somewhat frustrating (including a three hour debugging session regarding one single line of code!) I'm excited to see how these skills will translate to future success down the line. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

To run this application, you will need to install Node.js, and the NPM package.. Instructions on installing these packages can be found here: https://www.guru99.com/download-install-node-js.html

Once these are installed, enter "npm i" to installed related dependencies, Inquirer and FS. If for some reason, these do not install, instructions on installing them directly can be found here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer , https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html , respectively. 

## Usage
Once all necessary packages have been downloaded, right click on index.js in the sidebar. Find 'run in integrated terminal, and type in "node index.js" You will then be given several prompts from which to generate your readme. Once finished, the generated README will appear in the sidebar, within the "Develop" folder. There will be a separate README always present, this is the static README for this project, that you are now reading.
